# fix-url-encoded-filename
This script is for Mac users!

I use Microsoft Outlook on Macbook Pro at work. I get many Korean filename attachments through email and most of them turn into unrecognizable url encoded characters like "ABC%D0%EB%CF.pptx".

So I made this python script for Hazel to automatically recognizes "%" included file then fix the file name.
this is tested on python 2.7.10.
